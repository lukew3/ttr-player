PLAN
====

---

* Replay will look like monkeytype
  * Prompt is shown in grey and filled in white and red when
* Button for play pause
* Clicking on the text will move the cursor to that point

---

* Handle different rules

---

* Handle signatures

---

* Handle different sites styles

----

* Make a module that can be imported so that the replay can be used on other sites
* How it will be used:
  * Create an html div with id="ttr-player-cont"
  * Import the "ttr-player" js package 
    * ttr-player finds "ttr-player-cont" and sets it up
